                I am currently a 19 year old freshman at the University of Notre Dame studying Computer Engineering. 
                I enjoy exploring my interests in computer software through expanding my knowledge on the many facets of the software world.

                On my own time, I often can be found learning more about web development, looking into a new code topic, or doing work for a club I'm involved in.

                I also do undergraduate research in Notre Dame's SaNDwich Lab which is a Computer Science lab focused on AI applications in Human Computer Interaction.

                When I'm not on my computer or doing homework I love to play card/board games and watch Notre Dame football.
                Throughout my high school years as a Boy Scout, I also earned the rank of Eagle Scout.
